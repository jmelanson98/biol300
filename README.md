# Welcome to BIOL 300, LO3 and L10

The purpose of this repo is mainly for me to share slides from lab, but I may also post some code snippets or other updates...we'll see! 

Please be aware that all important course materials can be found on **Canvas**, and that any resources linked here will also be shared on the course **Piazza**

My office hours 11am-12pm in BRC 5006. For instructions on how to find the room or schedule additional/online office hours, please see the [lecture slides](https://github.com/jmelanson98/biol300/blob/main/lab1_slides.pdf) from lab 1. (Note: if you have issues viewing the pdf on GitHub---which you probably will---you should download and open the file.)

You can reach me by email at jenna.melanson @ ubc.ca (without spaces), but please remember to post all general questions to the course **Piazza**.

Looking forward to an exciting semester of statistics!
